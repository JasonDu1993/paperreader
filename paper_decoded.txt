We continue along this trajectory and introduce a novel ¡°stacked hourglass¡± network design for predicting human pose. The network captures and consolidates information across all scales of the image. We refer to the design as an hourglass based on our visualization of the steps of pooling and subsequent upsampling used to get the final output of the network. Like many convolutional approaches that produce pixel-wise outputs, the hourglass network pools down to a very low resolution, then upsamples and combines features across multiple resolutions [15,23]. On the other hand, the hourglass differs from prior designs primarily in its more symmetric topology. 
  We expand on a single hourglass by consecutively placing multiple hourglass modules together end-to-end. This allows for repeated bottom-up, top-down inference across scales. In conjunction with the use of intermediate supervision, repeated bidirectional inference is critical to the network¡¯s final performance. The final network architecture achieves a significant improvement on the stateof- the-art for two standard pose estimation benchmarks (FLIC [1] and MPII Human Pose [21]). On MPII there is over a 2% average accuracy improvement across all joints, with as much as a 4¨C5% improvement on more difficult joints like the knees and ankles1.
